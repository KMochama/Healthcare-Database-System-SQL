# Avenue Hospital Database System Design, Creation, and Implementation. 

## Introduction

As the Data Analyst consultant for Avenue Hospital, my role was to design, create, and implement a robust database system tailored to the healthcare industry's specific needs. The objective was to develop a system capable of efficiently managing patient **registrations, appointments, medical records, and doctor-patient interactions while ensuring data integrity, security, and scalability.** The goal was to provide an organized and structured approach to storing and retrieving healthcare-related data in a manner that supports daily hospital operations.

The system also had to meet the clientâ€™s detailed requirements, which ranged from patient registration and medical record management to appointment scheduling and feedback handling. The need for normalization (3NF), high availability, and ease of use for hospital staff guided the design process.

# Hosptial Requirements Breakdown
## The following key requirements were outlined by the client:
1. **Patient Registration:** Patients need to be able to register with essential personal information and optional contact details.
2. **Appointment Booking:** Patients should be able to book appointments through a portal, checking for doctor availability.
3. **Appointment Details Storage:** Appointments should include the date, time, department, status, and assigned doctor.
4. **Medical Record Updates:** Doctors should be able to review and update patient medical records during appointments.
5. **Patient Feedback:** Patients can provide feedback after appointments.
6. **Cancelled Appointments:** Cancelled appointments should require rebooking.
7. **Patient Data Retention:** Patient data should be retained even after they leave the hospital system, with their exit date recorded.
